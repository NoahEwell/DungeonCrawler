Some of the first object-oriented code I'd ever written is in this project. I made this 1-level dungeon crawler as part of my Intro to Programming Fundamentals course. As I was learning programming when making this, the code is poorly commented at some parts. I have no intention of creating additional levels for it but encourage others to use it as a start for their dungeon crawler games if they'd like.
